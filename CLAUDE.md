# Agent Instructions

This project follows [Punt Labs standards](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit).

## No "Pre-existing" Excuse

There is no such thing as a "pre-existing" issue. If you see a problem — in code you wrote, code a reviewer flagged, or code you happen to be reading — you fix it. Do not classify issues as "pre-existing" to justify ignoring them. Do not suggest that something is "outside the scope of this change." If it is broken and you can see it, it is your problem now.

## Scratch Files

Use `.tmp/` at the project root for scratch and temporary files — never `/tmp`. The `TMPDIR` environment variable is set via `.envrc` so that `tempfile` and subprocesses automatically use it. Contents are gitignored; only `.gitkeep` is tracked.

## Quality Gates

Run before every commit. Zero violations, zero errors, all tests green.

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy src/ tests/
uv run pyright src/ tests/
uv run pytest
```

## Pre-PR Checklist

- [ ] **CHANGELOG entry included in the PR diff** (see Documentation Discipline below)
- [ ] **README updated** if user-facing behavior changed
- [ ] **PR/FAQ updated** if product direction shifted
- [ ] **Quality gates pass**

## Documentation Discipline

### CHANGELOG

Entries are written **in the PR branch, before merge** — not retroactively on main. If a PR changes user-facing behavior and the diff does not include a CHANGELOG entry, the PR is not ready to merge. Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Add entries under `## [Unreleased]`. Categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security.

### README

Update `README.md` when user-facing behavior changes — new flags, commands, defaults, or config. The README is the first thing users see; it must stay current with the code.

### PR/FAQ

Update `prfaq.tex` when a change shifts product direction or validates/invalidates a risk assumption. The PR/FAQ is a living document — it evolves as the product learns from real usage.

## Code Review Flow

Do **not** merge immediately after creating a PR. Expect **2–6 review cycles** before merging.

1. **Create PR** — push branch, open PR via `mcp__github__create_pull_request`. Prefer MCP GitHub tools over `gh` CLI.
2. **Request Copilot review** — use `mcp__github__request_copilot_review`.
3. **Watch for feedback in the background** — `gh pr checks <number> --watch` in a background task or separate session. Do not stop waiting. Copilot and Bugbot may take 1–3 minutes after CI completes.
4. **Read all feedback** via MCP: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` with `get_reviews` and `get_review_comments`.
5. **Take every comment seriously.** There is no such thing as "pre-existing" or "unrelated to this change" — if you can see it, you own it. If you disagree, explain why in a reply.
6. **Fix and re-push** — commit fixes, push, re-run quality gates.
7. **Repeat steps 3–6** until the latest review is **uneventful** — zero new comments, all checks green.
8. **Merge only when the last review was clean** — use `mcp__github__merge_pull_request` (not `gh pr merge`).

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **beads** (`bd`) for issue tracking. If an issue discovered here affects multiple repos or requires a standards change, escalate to a [punt-kit bead](https://github.com/punt-labs/punt-kit) instead (see [bead placement scheme](../CLAUDE.md#where-to-create-a-bead)).

## Ethos & Delegation

Identity: `agent: claude` per `.punt-labs/ethos.yaml`. Sub-agent calls match ethos identity handles.

This repo wraps OpenAI Image and Pexels providers behind the `langlearn-types` `ImageProvider` protocol. Provider implementations carry API keys and sit on a network boundary — security review is part of every change. Worker and evaluator must be distinct handles with no shared role. Claude is the leader, never the evaluator.

| Task type | Worker | Evaluator |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Python provider implementation | `rmh` (Hettinger) | `gvr` (van Rossum) |
| Provider protocol / contract | `gvr` | `rmh` |
| API key / credential handling | `rmh` | `djb` (Bernstein) — implementation correctness |
| Threat model — network calls, prompt injection into image gen | `claude` (leader) | `bcs` (Schneier) |
| Pexels query construction (cultural context) | `rmh` | `claudia` (Massimo) — editorial sensibility |
| CLI surface | `mdm` (McIlroy) | `rop` (Pike) |
| Two-stage GPT image flow | `rmh` | `kpz` (Karpathy) — model behavior |
| Cost / quota / rate limiting | `rmh` | `mdm` — pipeline composition |
| Infra / CI / release | `adb` (Lovelace) | `kth` (Hightower) |

Use the `standard` pipeline for features, `coverage` for test gaps, `coe` for failure investigation across providers.
