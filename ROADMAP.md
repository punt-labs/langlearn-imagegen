- Evaluation hook exists, but no built-in evaluators or two-stage flow yet.

## In progress

- langlearn-imagegen-z8t — Refresh documentation and roadmap.

## Next

- langlearn-imagegen-pob — Align OpenAI image API (gpt-image + two-stage).
- langlearn-imagegen-bz5 — Add Pexels query generation with cultural context.
- langlearn-imagegen-r7y — Implement image evaluation and two-stage generation.

## Dependencies

- langlearn-3lz and langlearn-yjb in the orchestrator depend on imagegen evaluation results.
